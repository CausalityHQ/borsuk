# OPQ8 proofs

Run `lean Opq8Planner.lean` from this directory with the pinned Lean
toolchain. The file imports only `Std` and contains no admitted theorems.

The model covers the 100k one-GET-per-group planner. It proves group
selection order, uniqueness under a unique input ranking, exact byte
accounting and the 32-read/16-MiB caps. It also proves one pairwise
fixed-point score-order lemma, truth-owner counting lemmas conditional on
the owners already being certified as selected, and 8-byte code-plane
arithmetic. It assumes valid group lengths and an authenticated ranking.
The 1M planner merges adjacent groups and has a different GET count;
its proof, Python refinement, and numerical certificates for actual
queries are separate work.
