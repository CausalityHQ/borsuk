# Algorithm-first page-layout ledger

This ledger records the screens that decide whether BORSUK's blob-native
serving path can reach the quality bar on a hard 1M corpus. Every row here is
**evidence class 3** (scale/workload study) on the frozen ReLAION2B screen
registered in [methods](methods.md); none of it is a release claim, and none of
it is comparable to the vendor-reported numbers in
[market benchmark matrix](market-benchmark-matrix.md).

All screens use the same immutable inputs:

| Input | Object | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| corpus | `v36-prefix-screen/.../attempt-0000/source.parquet` | `2796b579…0560cf86` |
| queries | `…/development-query.parquet` | `310bb54f…dadb2db54` |
| ground truth | `…/development-gt100.parquet` | `fed7524f…8b6c696e11` |

1,000,000 rows x 768 dimensions, 1,000 development queries, exact squared-L2
GT@100.

## V60 — can a proximity graph return the actual top-100 at all?

`scripts/v60_algorithm_first_diskann_returned_recall.py`, result
`research/v60-algorithm-first/diskann-returned-recall-6f193347e7ce5f86/a0001/`.

A standard DiskANN build (degree 64, build complexity 200) was measured on
**returned** Recall@100, not page containment.

| Setting | Aggregate Recall@100 | Worst query | p50 | p99 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| complexity 128, beam 2, 1,000 queries | **99.595%** | **89.0%** | 44.648 ms | 46.942 ms |

Latency is local baseline-gp3 EBS on one Spot node; it is **not** an S3 number
and is never reported as one. S3 GETs and payload were not measured.

**Verdict: the graph family can meet the quality bar.** The problem is cost:
the serialized index is 11,061,547,192 bytes, or 11,061 bytes per row — 3.6x
the raw f32 payload. That is not a blob-native index.

## V61 — can static graph-order page packing carry that quality?

`scripts/v61_algorithm_first_graph_page_ceiling.py`, result
`research/v61-algorithm-first/graph-page-ceiling-a613f66b86eb2952/a0001/`.

The V60 topology was preserved and screened under three query-independent row
orders with an optimistic exact-score traversal — an upper bound on what any
real implementation of that layout could reach.

| Packing | rows/page | Aggregate | Worst query | pages p50/p95 | bytes/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| bfs | 128 | 96.876% | 72.0% | 64 / 64 | 27.40 MiB |
| bfs | 64 | 94.580% | 69.0% | 64 / 64 | 13.70 MiB |
| bfs | 32 | 90.836% | 61.0% | 64 / 64 | 6.85 MiB |
| original | 128 | 60.328% | 49.0% | 64 / 64 | 27.40 MiB |
| random | 128 | 60.392% | 49.0% | 64 / 64 | 27.40 MiB |

The screen required 99% aggregate, 70% worst query, p95 <= 32 pages and
<= 16 MiB. **Every cell failed**, and every cell saturated the 64-page cap.

Two facts matter more than the pass/fail:

1. Graph BFS order is worth roughly 36 recall points over source or random
   order, so page locality is real — it is just not sufficient.
2. Because p50 = p95 = max = 64 pages everywhere, V61 measured a
   **routing-limited** traversal, not a containment ceiling. It could not
   distinguish "the layout cannot hold the answer" from "the traversal cannot
   find it".

Separating those two is what V63 exists to do.

## V63 — containment or discovery?

`scripts/v63_algorithm_first_layout_oracle.py`, result
`research/v63-algorithm-first/layout-oracle-e2f6c2bad99c720b/a0001/`,
result SHA-256 `608ceff4…4598de9a`, 6:40 wall, 10.5 GiB peak RSS.

V63 screens the two halves of V61's failure separately. Layouts are built from
the corpus alone — no query, no ground truth — and then evaluated three ways:

- **linear** — one contiguous row permutation cut into fixed pages. Each row
  appears once, so the best-K-pages oracle is **exact**.
- **replicated** — SPANN-style postings, each row written into its `r` nearest
  centroids' lists, pages never straddling a list. Its oracle is greedy
  max-coverage, a **lower bound** on the true ceiling (measured shortfall
  <= 1.25 pp, `scripts/verify_v63_greedy_gap.py`), so a pass is conclusive and
  a failure is not.
- **routed** — the same postings read by a fixed untrained rule: lists in
  ascending centroid distance. Every fetched row is exactly rescored, so this
  containment **is** Recall@100 for an exact-rerank serving path.

The vectorised router is checked against a naive reference implementation on
every replication/page-size cell (`scripts/verify_v63_router.py`).

### Geometric order beats graph order, decisively

At 256 rows/page and a 32-page budget, aggregate oracle containment:

| Linear layout | Aggregate | Worst query |
|---|---:|---:|
| k-means 8192, centroid-chain order | **99.479%** | 72.0% |
| k-means 1024, centroid-chain order | 97.869% | 57.0% |
| DiskANN BFS order (from V61) | 82.762% | 48.0% |
| source order | 33.306% | 32.0% |
| random order | 33.247% | 32.0% |

This settles V61: its BFS packing was not merely under-routed, it was the
wrong layout. A corpus-only k-means order is worth ~17 points over it.

### Containment is solved at 1.00x storage

Linear k-means 8192, no replication, storage multiplier exactly 1.00:

| rows/page | 32 pages | 48 pages | 64 pages | 96 pages |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 128 | 98.47% / 64% | 99.83% / 80% | 99.99% / 96% | **100.00% / 100%** |
| 256 | 99.48% / 72% | 99.96% / 88% | **100.00% / 100%** | 100.00% / 100% |

At 256 rows/page, 64 pages is 16,384 rows and 12.25 MiB under the sq8 cost
model, and it contains **every** ground-truth neighbour of **every** query.

Replication is not worth buying. It moves full containment from 64 pages to 48
and costs 3-9x storage; and because inflating posting lists means a fixed page
budget reaches fewer distinct lists, it barely helps the actual router.

### Discovery is the entire remaining gap

The same layout, read by the untrained nearest-centroid posting router:

| Budget | Oracle (linear, x1.00) | Router (r=1, 256 rows) | Router worst query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 pages | 99.48% | 93.13% | 26% |
| 64 pages | 100.00% | 96.71% | 48% |
| 128 pages | 100.00% | 98.57% | 69% |

The router never reaches the ceiling, and the shortfall is far worse on the
worst query than in aggregate: where the oracle holds 100% of every query's
neighbours in 64 pages, the router finds 48% of the hardest query's.

**Verdict: the layout question is closed and the routing question is open.**
Static page layout can hold a 100%-Recall@100 answer set inside 64 pages and
12.25 MiB at 1.00x storage. What does not yet exist is a page selector good
enough to find those pages. Two structural reasons the current one cannot:
it routes at posting-list granularity while the oracle selects pages, and with
8,192 clusters over 1M rows the median list is 118 rows, so a list-granular
router spends its budget in the wrong units.

Next: a page-granular router over the preserved
`kmeans_8192-order.npy` layout, scored against this exact 100%/64-page ceiling.
