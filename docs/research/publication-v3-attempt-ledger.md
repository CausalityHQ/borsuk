# Publication V3 attempt ledger — 2026-08-25

This ledger records terminal Publication V3 attempts, including attempts that
cannot contribute to a publication claim. It prevents outcome-based selection
and preserves the exact boundary that must be repaired before another paid
attempt. Terminal marker and receipt objects are authoritative; a locally
observed process exit is not a substitute for those objects.

No artifact from a failed runtime attempt is merged into another attempt. A
completed cell remains bound to its source, manifest, protocol, build receipt,
arm, and attempt identity. A partial campaign does not authorize a comparative
or aggregate publication claim.

## Standard ANN read campaign

The first scheduled BORSUK cell of `standard-ann-read` used cell identity
`r01-f4b9090272773676be960bbd` and one immutable build:

All attempts used EC2 Spot in AWS account `453182569524`. The controller
terminated each instance after its terminal marker; no campaign instance was
left running.

| Role / arm | Attempt | Instance | Terminal state | Terminal-marker SHA-256 | Boundary |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| build | 1 | `i-003d0d872898399c6` | complete | `4992ce9f1f92bacacd00c88d5e2f8c935e899aea79db72f2d0720e32ae197e7f` | Immutable BORSUK index build completed and published its receipt. |
| recall arm 0 (`cold`) | 1 | `i-0879428218d03f90c` | complete | `f103648ae3858bf6ccce3cf2868dbad625c13fc8005914127e0074c10cf21d3e` | The exact cell passed result validation and published `RESULT_COMPLETE.json`. |

The terminal marker prefixes are:

### Completed cold-cell evidence

The cold cell measured 1,000 queries and is valid evidence for that exact cell,
but not for a completed campaign or third-party comparison:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| recall@10 | 97.41% |
| latency p50 | 143.564 ms |
| latency p95 | 238.364 ms |
| latency p99 | 332.367 ms |
| throughput | 6.475 queries/s |
| peak RSS | 1,189,474,304 bytes |
| backing bytes read | 27,098,790,672 bytes |
| backing GETs | 54,625 |
| global leaf code requests | 42,887 |
| global leaf exact requests | 11,738 |

The cell used a 2 GiB RAM budget, no disk cache, S3 GET concurrency 64,
leaf-read width 32, 48 maximum in-flight leaf reads, four active searches, and
exact-read physical amplification 2. Its result object is bound to index
receipt SHA-256
`54c01a9131905f36001f517e3011cd9691f0447e99b2bb7c4ec0ac65fc8ee08a`.

### Warm failure decision

The failure is a benchmark-methodology defect, not a warm performance result.
The disk directory was cleared between bounded query cohorts while the same
open serving handle retained decoded and code-plane RAM state. Priming a later
cohort could therefore be satisfied by RAM without recreating its disk-cache
objects; subsequent RAM eviction allowed the measured query to reach S3. This
explains why the first cohort passed and the next cohort failed at query 20.

The failed attempt authorizes no latency, throughput, cost, or comparison
claim. A replacement attempt must use a frozen repair that makes the disk cache
the only state shared between priming and measurement, preserves the immutable
attempt numbering, and rebuilds under the repaired source authority.

## Repaired cache-isolation rerun

The replacement cell used source commit
`23aa21506dd81c8ca0fddaeaf439ed2342741db9` and cell identity
`r01-ab690b34e46e4c84ad4d130e`. Its immutable authority is:

- source archive SHA-256:
  `c290aec5c4a0fa85dc7e4ec46dad5f29f927970652e7b4fe2b29ec052677d509`;
- manifest SHA-256:
  `bc61b3512ce9f35e57763fa787745956743bb6129a9796a9069ccff6b9608978`;
- build/runtime protocol SHA-256:

Every completed job used EC2 Spot. The first warm-concurrency controller launch
exhausted its three SDK `RunInstances` retries with
`InsufficientInstanceCapacity`, all under one client token and before instance
creation. A second controller launch reused the same immutable attempt and
idempotent client token, then acquired Spot capacity. No On-Demand exception,
replacement attempt, or partial artifact was used.

The controller terminated every instance after its terminal marker. The
replacement read artifacts are `publishable:true`, share the exact build
receipt SHA-256
`2667d679bf8d31d205b587659475238a17d17692348ec7b5d5f4df45394d5e63`,
and report the following result boundary:

| Cache state | Recall@10 | p50 | p95 | p99 | Single-query throughput | Peak RSS | Measured backing I/O |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cold | 99.04% | 54.316 ms | 99.679 ms | 118.535 ms | 17.002 qps | 208,474,112 bytes | 9,345 GETs / 612,487,936 bytes |
| warm | 99.04% | 8.060 ms | 10.349 ms | 11.381 ms | 121.830 qps | 219,058,176 bytes | zero GETs / zero bytes |

The concurrency sweep preserved 99.04% recall for every row:

| Cache state | Workers | Throughput | p50 | p95 | p99 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| cold | 1 | 25.599 qps | 37.556 ms | 54.982 ms | 68.582 ms |
| cold | 2 | 49.283 qps | 38.218 ms | 56.226 ms | 70.575 ms |
| cold | 4 | 94.675 qps | 39.752 ms | 59.110 ms | 71.949 ms |
| cold | 8 | 154.049 qps | 49.000 ms | 69.141 ms | 90.751 ms |
| cold | 16 | 161.415 qps | 96.190 ms | 117.074 ms | 130.448 ms |
| warm | 1 | 119.494 qps | 8.224 ms | 10.484 ms | 11.522 ms |
| warm | 2 | 153.394 qps | 12.822 ms | 16.180 ms | 18.468 ms |
| warm | 4 | 170.896 qps | 21.593 ms | 34.431 ms | 40.284 ms |
| warm | 8 | 174.750 qps | 40.765 ms | 58.539 ms | 66.668 ms |
| warm | 16 | 174.243 qps | 62.977 ms | 91.303 ms | 101.462 ms |

Cold concurrency peaked at 262,488,064 bytes RSS; warm concurrency peaked at
252,170,240 bytes RSS. Both runtime attestations report zero swap, zero OOM
events, and zero OOM-kill events. Every warm measurement row reports zero
backing GETs and bytes; its measured bytes are explicitly separated into
decoded-RAM and local-disk tiers.
